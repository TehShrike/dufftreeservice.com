Scott Williams	https://share.google/bczTpJXv4zzyJTSXK	Andrew Duff runs a tight ship. Professional and courteous, he discussed the removal of a broken limb with me, suggested some changes to my existing trees and ways to improve the overall landscape with tree changes. Given the location of the branch removal and the efforts of Andrew and his assistant, the rather large branch was removed without incident and the tree materials cleaned up from the yard and carted away. Recommend Duff Tree Service highly. Great service and reasonably priced. A Great combination!
Tim P	https://share.google/IuOkqaIA5r811URZu	Fast response for estimate and work. Careful trimming on neighbor's tree that extends over my property. I recommend Duff Tree Service highly!
Stacy Sliva	https://share.google/M09wv6wQwn2Xn61Py	Reasonable prices and efficient work! He also has a deep appreciation and understanding of native trees and was able to help me save my 50 year old burr oak after it was hit by a massive wind storm.
