	<h1>Tree Trimming</h1>
	<p>
		With trimming and pruning, the most important thing is not what you cut, but what you don’t cut. This is true whether you are doing young tree training, reduction pruning, or deadwood removal. We make sure to provide the best trimming service by: Sterilizing equipment between trees, educating every employee on correct practices regularly, making proper cuts that leave the trees healing response tissue intact. Making sure to prune just enough to get the desired response; not too much, and not too little.
	</p>
	<p>
		We apply these, and other best practices to scenarios like: large tree trimming, young tree training, limb weight reductions, fruit tree pruning, deadwood removal, clearance pruning, storm mitigation pruning.
