If you want to test locally pretty easily:

1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
2. clone this repository locally somehow (the [Github desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/) works if you don't have any other preferences)
3. open the directory for this project locally with your command-line
4. run `npm i`
5. run `npm start`

After doing that setup, all you'll need to do is navigate to the directory with your command-line and run `npm start`
